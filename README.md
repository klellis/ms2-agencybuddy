This project was made with the modern Digital Marketer in mind.
Coming myself from this background I wanted to create a tool/resource that would be useful and insightful for a Digital Marketer in their daily life. 

I often found myself stressed out and pressed for time and tasks that i'd usually be able to do without issue seemed impossible because there was so much going on and to prepare for. 

I created some basic tools that I would use in my every day life. These are real life things that I have previously found myself Googling on a regular basis but they never gave me exactly what I was asking for. 

Also in mind is the prospect of my future career. Having an understanding of the digital marketing world and applying that to my new learnings in front end development will hopefully show potential employers that I have a solid all round understanding of their business needs and can add real value.
